This is my attempt to solve all of the problems from Project Euler in as
many languages as possible.  My goal is to, wherever possible, create a single
source file which produces a single interpreted script or compiled executable
which when invoked from the command line with no arguments will print the
answers to each of the euler problems in order, or, if invoked with arguments
treats the arguments as problem numbers and prints the answer to the
appropriate problems.

Missing languages that I would like to add:
Objective-C
Logo
Mathematica
R
Oz
OCaml
PHP? Maybe not, just on principal.
Prolog
Postscript
SQL?
