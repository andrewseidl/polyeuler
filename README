This is my attempt to solve all of the problems from Project Euler in as
many languages as possible.  My goal is to, wherever possible, create a single
source file which produces a single interpreted script or compiled executable
which when invoked from the command line with no arguments will print the
answers to each of the euler problems in order, or, if invoked with arguments
treats the arguments as problem numbers and prints the answer to the
appropriate problems.

CURRENT SOLUTIONS
=================
(Languages with at least one solution implemented (number of solutions
in parens)):

C (2) +cli
Clojure (4+) -cli
Erlang (5) -cli
Java (2) +cli
Javascript (2) +cli
Common LISP (2) +partial cli
Lua (4) +cli
Pascal (2) -cli
Perl (2) +cli
Python (4) + cli
Ruby (2) +cli
Scheme (2) -cli
Haskell (20) -cli

That's 13 languages with 53 (overlapping) solutions.

COMING SOON
===========
Languages I have created the files for but don't have any working
solutions yet:

Rebol


Missing languages that I would like to add:
===========================================
Scala
OCaml
Objective-C
Prolog


Maybe some day:
===============
Basic
C#
Logo
Mathematica
R
Oz
PHP? Maybe not, just on principal.
Postscript
SQL?
Maude
Brainfuck
Whitespace
unix shells (bash / ksh / csh / tcsh / zsh)
other misc unixy things (awk, sed, etc)
TCL
